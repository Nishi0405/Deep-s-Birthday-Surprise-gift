<h1>❤️ About Us ❤️</h1>

<div class="container">
    <div class="story-box">
        <p>
            This is the story of <b>Us💕</b></b> —  
            two souls who met unexpectedly and connected beautifully.  
            A connection filled with laughter, care, warmth, mischief,  
            hugs, late-night talks, and endless love. ❤️  
        </p>
		<p>
		Jaan, our story didn’t start like a typical love story… it started with a CR election on the very first year of college.
		19th July 2024 — just a normal day for everyone else, but the day I first spoke to you. We didn’t know then that deciding 
		who shouldn’t become CR would one day turn into deciding to spend life together.
		</P>
		
		<p>
		We became friends when we shouldn’t have, I was already in a relationship… a toxic one. And somehow, without asking,
		you became my safest place. I used to cry about everything — my relationship, my family, my life — and you listened, 
		every single time. We even treated each other like brother and sister, and I almost tied you a rakhi… but fate stopped us.
		And now I know why.
		</p>

		<p>
		Then February came… 3rd Feb 2025, 1:30 am — the moment you confessed your feelings. You loved me silently, patiently, 
		without ever wanting to lose our friendship. I was scared, full of broken pieces from my past, but you held each one 
		of them gently until I felt whole again. A week later, we officially began a journey that already felt like destiny.
		</P>
		
		<p>
		Our little adventures — visiting Iskcon, Tapovan temple, spontaneous movie plans, traveling in public transport, then 
		riding on your first bike… those memories became the softest parts of my life. You bought me flowers without any reason, 
		treated me like a kid with Kinder Joy and balloons, fed me with your hands, and gave me a place in your lap when I couldn’t 
		even stand emotionally. You gave me childhood moments I never got to experience. You gave me peace. You gave me home.
		</P>
		
		<p>
		Then came September 2025 — our fresher’s event. We danced together, walked the ramp as a couple, laughed like we owned the moment…
		and the same week, everything collapsed. My parents found out. They scolded me, threatened us, hurt me, tried to break us… but somehow,
		even with all the pain, I never let go of you. We cried away from each other, but our hearts stayed close. And slowly life settled again 
		— my phone, my laptop returned — but my parents still don’t understand us.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		But you, Jaan… you understood me in ways even my family never could. You cared for me, loved me, respected me, protected me. 
		You gave me the childhood I lost, the comfort I craved, and a love I didn’t know I deserved.
		</p>
		<p>
		You’re not just someone I love…
		You’re the one who became my home, my safest place, my calm after every storm.
		You’re my Jaan, my Whole World, my Happiness,my Love, my everything.”
        <p>
            We both grew together, healed together, and learned how powerful  
            love can be when the right hearts meet.  
        </p>

        <p>
            No distance… no problems… nothing can take away what we both share.  
            Because what we two have *pure, magical, once-in-a-lifetime love*. 💞
